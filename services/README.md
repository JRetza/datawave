# DATAWAVE Services

This directory formerly contained DATAWAVE microservices and associated utilities.
However, in order to better maintain these objects that were considered to be
separate, independently releasable items, they have been moved to separate
repositories.

In order to simplify locating all of the available services (and to store some
ancillary code such as example configuration and docker setup), a repository
has been created containing some basic information and submodules for each of
the services. That repository can be found [here](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/datawave-microservices-root).
