# DATAWAVE Contributions

## Quickstart

The quickstart is meant to be a simple way to get started with Datawave.
See the [README](datawave-quickstart/README.md) in the `datawave-quickstart`
folder. 

## Other Contributions

The code-style and maven plugins (read-properties and assert-properties) have
been moved to a separate [repository](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/datawave-utils).
